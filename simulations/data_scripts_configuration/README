SAMoS configuration and input files are included so that all simulations that are used to 
generate data for Figures 6-11 can be reproduced. Additionally, the scripts used to run 
a set of simulations, then analyse and plot the results, as is done for Figure 7, are included.
Please note that, unlike the SAMoS package, these scripts are not intended to run 'out of the box'
and should instead be used as a reference. A number of more general analysis
tools can be found included in the SAMoS package. For a detailed description of 
how to write a SAMoS configuration file please refer to the SAMoS documentation.

The SAMoS package is freely available at https://github.com/sknepneklab/SAMoS
